## Brief

Generally its a good practice to write down your thoughts and ideas as
they come up in your minds. And study these items to see
if they are **feasible**, **useful** and **profitable**.
This is how the companies know how to make next generation products.

Sadly not everybody believes in your ideas. You might lack confidence in your
own ideas. We will know how good our ideas are only after implementing and
taking feedback from the target audience.

Those who believe in their ideas like me might lack skills or time to
accomplish them. So I decided to keep those ideas here and work on them
one by one.

If anybody who is reading this page wants to suggest any ideas either new or
improvements to the existing ones please let me know via social media.

NOTE: These are just abstract ideas, how to implement, deploy, market
and monetize them will be a secret. :grin:
