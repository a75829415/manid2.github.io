## Introduction

Hello, I am **Mani Kumar** I work in C++ and Linux software development.
I graduated with Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE) from BMSCE, Bangalore, Karnataka, India in 2016.
So that gives me 2 years [as of 2018, i.e. at the time of writing this page] of work experience in C++ development for Linux systems.
Before joining my current company [TSIP](http://www.toshiba-tsip.com/tsip/), when in college I used to work in Python, OpenCV, Image Processing and Machine Learning.
Now I am confined to C++ and Linux Software development.
With experience in Cpp I began to realize its importance in Software Development.
And I liked it so much that I decided to share the knowledge to all the curious people.

Over time I have discovered many tips, tricks, tools and have implemented useful programs that
I use for my daily tasks. I need a place to document these and be able to go back to refer them.
So I don't have to reinvent the wheel. I often forget what I have learnt so far and need to refer
to my notes which is not convenient. So I decided to document them in this blog. And also to keep
a portfolio online to showcase my skills and expertise to the interested people.

## I'll be writing about

* Experiments and observations
* Tips and tricks in C++ coding
* Any idea for a tool or a software to be used in future
* Tutorials on how to design, develop, document, and maintain projects in C++ using my sample projects.s

## I do not write about

* Entry level tutorials as there are plenty of tutorials available for the same online.
